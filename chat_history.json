I've successfully implemented the changes to use the Sansita font for the Scoutpost logo. Here's what I did:\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n1. **Installed the Sansita font package**: Added `@expo-google-fonts/sansita` to the project dependencies.\n\n2. **Updated `app/_layout.tsx`**: \n   - Imported `Sansita_400Regular` and `Sansita_700Bold` from the Sansita font package\n   - Added these fonts to the `useFonts` hook so they're loaded when the app starts\n\n3. **Updated `app/index.tsx`** (Login Screen):\n   - Applied `fontFamily: 'Sansita_700Bold'` to the main \"Scoutpost\" title text\n   - This gives the logo a bold, distinctive appearance using the Sansita font\n\n4. **Updated `components/ProfileScreen.tsx`** (Profile Screen):\n   - Applied `fontFamily: 'Sansita_400Regular'` to the \"Scoutpost v1.0.0\" text in the app info section at the bottom\n   - This maintains consistency with the logo font throughout the app\n\n## Result:\n\nNow the Scoutpost logo will display using the Sansita font in both locations:\n- **Login screen**: Bold Sansita font for the main logo\n- **Profile screen**: Regular Sansita font for the app version info\n\nThe Sansita font gives the Scoutpost logo a more distinctive, friendly, and approachable appearance that's perfect for a scouting community app. The font will load automatically when the app starts, and all instances of the Scoutpost logo will now use this consistent typography."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-18T07:34:09Z"}]
