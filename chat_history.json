I've successfully implemented the requested changes to add \"Troop\" and \"Role\" fields to the signup form that will auto-populate in the user profile. Here's a summary of what I've implemented:\n\n## Key Changes Made:\n\n### 1. **Supabase Integration**\n- Created `lib/supabase.ts` with proper Supabase client configuration\n- Created `lib/types.ts` with TypeScript interfaces for user profiles\n- Installed required dependencies: `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`\n\n### 2. **Enhanced Signup Form** (`app/index.tsx`)\n- Added \"Troop\" and \"Role\" input fields to the signup form\n- Integrated with Supabase authentication\n- Implemented email verification with proper redirect URL\n- Added loading states and error handling\n- Stores user metadata (name, troop, role) during signup\n- Creates profile record in the database after successful signup\n\n### 3. **Updated Profile Screen** (`components/ProfileScreen.tsx`)\n- Fetches user profile data from Supabase database\n- Auto-populates name, email, troop, and role from signup data\n- Handles cases where profile doesn't exist (creates from auth metadata)\n- Displays troop and role prominently in the profile header\n- Determines admin status based on role (Scoutmaster, Leader, Admin)\n- Implements proper authentication state management\n\n### 4. **Enhanced Edit Profile** (`components/EditProfileScreen.tsx`)\n- Updated to work with the new UserProfile type from Supabase\n- Allows editing of troop and role fields\n- Validates required fields including troop and role\n- Saves changes back to Supabase database\n\n### 5. **Authentication Flow** (`app/main.tsx`)\n- Added authentication state checking\n- Redirects to login if not authenticated\n- Listens for auth state changes\n\n## Features Implemented:\n\n\u2705 **Troop field** in signup form with placeholder \"Troop (e.g., Troop 123)\"\n\n\u2705 **Role field** in signup form with placeholder \"Role (e.g., Scout, Scoutmaster, Assistant)\"\n\n\u2705 **Auto-population** of troop and role in user profile from signup data\n\n\u2705 **Database integration** with Supabase profiles table\n\n\u2705 **Email verification** during signup process\n\n\u2705 **Profile editing** with ability to modify troop and role\n\n\u2705 **Admin detection** based on role (Scoutmaster, Leader, Admin roles get admin privileges)\n\n\u2705 **Proper error handling** and loading states\n\n\u2705 **Authentication state management** throughout the app\n\nThe app now properly collects Troop and Role information during signup and automatically populates this information in the user's profile. Users can also edit these fields later through the Edit Profile screen. The system integrates seamlessly with Supabase for data persistence and authentication."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-18T12:54:23Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Center text under icons in nav"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will center the text under the icons in the main navigation.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-18T13:16:36.394457"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you center the text under the icons in the navigation.
